### 문제 설명

<p>We are given a graph which represents connections between nodes in the computer network, and the weight of an edge represents the bandwidth of a connection between two nodes. For the efficient data transmission between two nodes in the network, we are interested in finding a path between two nodes that has wide bandwidth. The bandwidth of a path is the minimum weight of an edge in the path. The widest path problem is to find the path between two nodes that has the maximum possible bandwidth.</p>

<p>For example, the widest path from node 1 to node 4 in Figure 1 has bandwidth 25, and passes through node 3 and node 2. The widest path from node 6 to node 3 has bandwidth 30, and passes through node 5.</p>

<p>Given two nodes in a graph, write a program which determines the bandwidth of the widest path between two nodes.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Your program is to read from standard input. The input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases T is given in the first line of the input. Each test case starts with a line containing four integers n, m, s and t for a connected graph, where n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1,000) represents the number of nodes and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n(n-1)/2) represents the number of edges, s and t (s≠t) represents the two nodes(nodes are numbered from 1 to n). In the following m lines, the bandwidth of the edges are given; each line contains three integers, u, v, and b, where b (1 ≤ b ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>) is the bandwidth of a connection between two nodes u and v.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Your program is to write to standard output. Print exactly one line for each test case. The line should contain the bandwidth of the widest path between two nodes s and t.</p>
